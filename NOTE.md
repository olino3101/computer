reduce form = everything = 0

degree of the equation = the biggest power of x

It’s solution(s) and the polarity of the discriminant if it makes sens.


exemple :

"5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"

Reduced form: 4 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 0
Polynomial degree: 2
Discriminant is strictly positive, the two solutions are:
0.905239
-0.475131


Discriminant Δ	What it Means	                How Many Answers
>0 (positive)	Two different real numbers	        2
=0 (zero)	One real number (a “double root”)	    1
<0 (negative)	No real numbers (imaginary answers)	0 (not real) 

x= 2a−b±b2−4ac

Where:

    a is the number in front of x2x2

    bb is the number in front of xx

    c is the constant number

4 + 4x - 9.3x^2 = 0

-4 + (RC(4^2 - (4 * -9.3 * 4))) / 2 * 9.3

-4 + (RC()) / 2 * 9.3



-4                 -4
4x - 9.3x^2 = -4
x(4 - 9.3x) = -4

1 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 = 0
1 + 4x = 0
-1        -1
4x = -1
/4 = -1/4
-0.25!

 * 4

4 * x^0 + 12 * X^1 = (1 * X^0 + 4 * X^1) * 4

5 + 4x = 0

4x = -5
/4 = -5/4

x = -5/4
