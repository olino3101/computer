# Computor v1 (Mandatory Only)

A simple Python program that solves polynomial equations of degree â‰¤ 2.

Usage:
  python computor.py "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"

Output:
  Reduced form: 4 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 0
  Polynomial degree: 2
  Discriminant is strictly positive, the two solutions are:
  0.905239
  -0.475131

Notes:
- Only accepts well-formed equations.
- Handles real and complex roots.
- Made for the 42 project "Computor v1"
